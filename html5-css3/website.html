			<p>Bollywood is the sobriquet for India's Hindi language film industry, based in the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay), Maharashtra.[4] It is more formally referred to as Hindi cinema.[5] The term "Bollywood" is often used by non-Indians as a synecdoche to refer to the whole of Indian cinema; however, Bollywood proper is only a part of the larger Indian film industry.</p>
			<p>By revenue, Bollywood is the largest film producer in India, representing 43% of the net box office, while Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitutes 21% as of 2014.[8] Bollywood is also one of the largest centers of film production in the world.[9][10][11] Furthermore, Bollywood is one of the biggest film industries in the world in terms of the number of people employed and the number of films produced.[12] According to J. Matusitz and P. Payano, in 2011, over 3.5 billion tickets were sold across the globe, which in comparison is 900,000 tickets more than Hollywood.[13] Bollywood produced 252 films in 2014 out of a total of 1969 films produced in Indian cinema.</p>

			<p>The cinema of Punjab has its beginnings with the 1928 production of Daughters of Today, the earliest feature film produced in Punjab. The first sound film, Heer Ranjha, using the sound-on-disc technology, was released in 1932. Since then, many films have been produced in Punjabi cinema, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers started their careers in Punjabi films, a number of whom have acquired international reputations, and a number of whom have found greater financial benefits in careers in larger film producing industries.

Today, the Punjabi film industry generates several commercially successful movies every year, making Punjabi cinema into an increasingly competitive producer of films in the world. The Punjabi film industry is doing what many couldn't even perceive; lifetime revenues are touching figures like ₹30 crore (US$4.7 million) and ₹40 crore (US$6.2 million). In reality the share of makers is 50% but even that is too much for an investment as little as ₹1.5 crore (US$230,000). The Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion Board and National Film Development Corporation of India (NFDC) has formulated Punjab Entertainment Industry and film Tourism Promotion Policy (PEIFTPP) 2013 by working in close association. Punjab State Film Commission has set up.</p>

			<p>In 1853, one adobe hut stood in Nopalera (Nopal field), named for the Mexican Nopal cactus indigenous to the area. By 1870, an agricultural community flourished. The area was known as the Cahuenga Valley, after the pass in the Santa Monica Mountains immediately to the north.

According to the diary of H. J. Whitley, known as the "Father of Hollywood," on his honeymoon in 1886 he stood at the top of the hill looking out over the valley. Along came a Chinese man in a wagon carrying wood. The man got out of the wagon and bowed. The Chinese man was asked what he was doing and replied, "I holly-wood," meaning 'hauling wood.' H. J. Whitley had an epiphany and decided to name his new town Hollywood. "Holly" would represent England and "wood" would represent his Scottish heritage. Whitley had already started over 100 towns across the western United States.</p>
